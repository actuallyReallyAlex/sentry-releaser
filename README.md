## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The Sentry CLI is friendly...but not that friendly. If you just want to grab all your code for a release and do something as simple as "sentry release v1.3.0", you can't. Especially if you're managing multiple projects across different repositories.

**Sentry Releaser** aims to help you manage your Sentry releases to be as pain free as possible.
